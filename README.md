##What Is This?
This tool provides one central place to manage your documentation allowing you to compose in Markdown and have the benefits of all of the following output formats:

1. HTML
2. Plaintext
3. MediaWiki
5. Advanced Help for Drupal

Gone are the days of having to update all your different documentation locations!

## As a Reader
1. To read documentation you probably just want to load `public_html/index.html` in a browser and proceed from there.
2. Plaintext documentation may also be available in `text/`
3. MediaWiki documentation is in `mediawiki/`

## As a Content Manager
1. You will need to read about compiling below; this is the step needed to generate derivative documentation from `/source`.

## As an Author
1. You will concern yourself with the `/source` directory, creating your source markdown files here.  This is the source of all documentation.

2. Only files in the `source` directory should  be edited.  All other files get created during compiling.

3. Images should e added to `source/images`.

4. Use relative links when linking to other pages inside `source`.

5. Use absolute links when linking to anything outside of `source`.

### Linking to Other Help Pages
You should do the following to link internally to `source/page2.html`

    <a href="page2.html">Link to Next Page</a>

### iFrames
One of the cool features is that compiling will grab iframe source and render it directly into the html for offline viewing.  The way to do this is just to include an `iframe` tag in your source code like so:

    <iframe src="http://www.my-site.com/admin/iframe/content" width="100%" height="100%"></iframe>

Then during compiling, the iframe source will be grabbed and then inserted as an html snippet in the place of the `iframe` tag.

#### Behind a Drupal Login
In some cases, your iframe content may be behind a Drupal login.  There is a contingency for this and it involves using the correct settings in `core-config.sh`.  You need to add or uncomment the following, replacing the credentials as appropriate.  That way the compiler will try to log in to your drupal site first before visiting the iframe source url.
    
    credentials = "http://user:pass@www.my-site.com/user/login";


## Use with Drupal
Compiling will output files compatible with the [Advanced Help Module for Drupal][help_module].  By default these files will output to a folder named `advanced_help`, but with a little configuration the folder will output directory to the root of your module folder as `help`.

This will also output `README.txt` directly to your module's root directory, so long as you create `/source/README.md` and make the settings shown below.

Follow these steps if you are using this for documenting a Drupal module:

1. Place this tool in the root of your module directory.  Add it to `.gitignore` so it doesn't get added to your module's repository.
3. Make sure the folder `help` does not exist in your module's root; if it does it will be erased!
4. Make sure `README.txt` does not exist in your module's root; if so it too will be erased during compiling.
1. Make sure the following settings are present in `core-config.sh`; replace `my_module` with the name of the module
        
        drupal_module = 'my_module';
        drupal_dir = '../help'
        README = '../README.txt'
        
2. Make sure to create `/source/README.md`; this compiles to `README.txt`.
3. You must also create the advanced help .ini file in `source/help.ini`.  **Please note that you should omit the module name!**  Just name it `help.ini`.  See this file `advanced_help/help/using-advanced-help.html` inside the [Advanced Help Module][help_module] for more info.

After you've written you markdown files, and compiled, you will see the `help` directory and the `README.txt` files in the root of your module.

### Links
Do not use `&topic:module/topic&` as is suggested, rather follow the instructions above and the Advanced Help topic links will automatically be generated for you.

### Images
Do not use the `&path&` convention when linking to images (as is recommended by the advanced help module), this convention will automatically be added for you during compiling.  Rather, do relative linking like this:

**Correct:**

    <img src="images/my_diagram.png" />

**In-Correct:**

    <img src="&path&images/my_diagram.png" />


## Compiling
### Requirements
Compiling requires the [Markdown Perl Binary][markdown], add it to the `core/Markdown.pl` or edit `core-config.sh` after installation with the path to `Markdown.pl`.

Output of `.txt` files requires that [Lynx][lynx] be installed.

~~Compiling relies on the [Code Kit app][codekit]; you should add this directory as a project before executing `compile.sh`.  The first time you compile you may need to manually compile the `.kit` files from the CodeKit UI.~~ As of version 0.4 there is no longer a dependency on [Code Kit][codekit].  I've written [a php compiler](https://github.com/aklump/kit_php) that handles the `.kit` file compiling, which is included.

Each time you want to update your documentation files, after modifying files in `source` you need to execute `compile.sh` from bash, make sure you are in the root directory of this package.

    ./core/compile.sh
    
## Installation
1. Download the [Markdown Perl Binary][markdown] and add it as `/core/Markdown.pl`.  **You may skip this step** if this is already installed somewhere else in your system; in that case you will need to edit `core-config.sh` (once it's been created) and point it to your `Markdown.pl` file.
1. ~~Add the root directory of this folder as a project in [Code Kit app][codekit]. **Do not adjust CodeKit project level settings** until after installation is complete, as the installation step overwrites `codekit-config.json`.~~
1. Run the compile command:

        ./core/compile.sh

2. The necessary dirs will be created including these configuration file(s):

        core-config.sh
  
1. Open and edit `core-config.sh`. **You should not delete this file once it's been created, as it is the flag that installation has taken place!** Compiling without this file may lead to some/all of your files being deleted.
2. Enter the name of the drupal module this will be used for, if applicable.
3. Enter the credentials for the drupal site if using iframes.
4. Override the php path if needed; php must have the curl library installed.
5. Run `./core/compile.sh` once more to update the configuration.
5. Test the installation by visiting `public_html/index.html` in a browser, this is the webpage output and should show you a few example pages.
7. Installation is complete; you may now begin documenting in `source`. You most likely should first delete the example files in `source`.

### Quick Installing Lynx on Mac
Here's a quick way to get Lynx on a mac...

1. Download this application [http://habilis.net/lynxlet/](http://habilis.net/lynxlet/)
2. In shell type `cd /usr/bin`
3. Followed by `sudo ln -s /Applications/Lynxlet.app/Contents/Resources/lynx/bin/lynx`
4. Test your installation with this command `lynx`; you should see the lynx browser show up.
 
   
## Theming
The files in `/core/tpl` control the output of the `.html` files found in the website folder `public_html`.  You should never modify these files, nor any files in `core`.  Instead to override the theming you should copy `core/tpl` up one directory into the base directory and override those files.

    cp -R core/tpl .
    
For css changes you should edit `/tpl/style.css` in the newly created `/tpl` file.
    

## Core Update
This script provides a self updating feature.  To update the core files, go into core and execute `update.sh`

    ./core/update.sh
    
## Rationale
The rationalle behind this project is that it is easy to write markdown files, and it is easy to share a static html based documentation file, and it is easy to use Drupal Advanced Help module, and it is easy to verison your documentation in git; but to do all this together at onceâ€¦ was NOT EASY.

So this project is born to satisfy this need.
