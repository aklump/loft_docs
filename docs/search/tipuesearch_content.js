Added support for includes for files ending in .twig.md. Todos are only compiled if you enable them in outline.merge.json. Todos are now present as an include file, not as a page.  Therefore you must both enable aggregation and use an include expression in a file.  See documentation for more info.   0.9.10   POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE: Added Deny from All to the .htaccess for public_html pattern.  If this breaks your compile, use a post compile hook to overwrite the default .htaccess file; see hooks\/htaccess.sh for an example of how to do this.  Be sure to register the hook file in core-config.sh in the post_hooks section, or it won't be called.   0.9   Removed support for kit templates. Now using Twig templates. Lost iframe support; plans to bring it back in future.   0.8.18   Removed all traces of doxygene due to no plans for implementation.   0.8.10   API CHANGE: auto-generated.outline.json is now called outline.auto.json   0.8   BREAKING CHANGE: The paths in the config var README are now relative to the directory that contains core-config.sh, not the source folder.

Enter the name of the drupal module this will be used for, if applicable. Enter the credentials for the drupal site if using iframes. Override the php path if needed; php must have the curl library installed. Run .\/core\/compile once more to update the configuration. Test the installation by visiting public_html\/index.html in a browser, this is the webpage output and should show you a few example pages.

How to install Lynx on Mac  Requirements   Here's a quick way to get Lynx on a mac... Download this application http:\/\/habilis.net\/lynxlet\/ In shell type cd \/usr\/bin Followed by sudo ln -s \/Applications\/Lynxlet.app\/Contents\/Resources\/lynx\/bin\/lynx Test your installation with this command lynx; you should see the lynx browser show up.   or with homebrew   brew install lynx     Installation Part 2  How you incorporate Loft Docs is up to you, but there are two scenarios which will be described here, with suggested installation instructions.  Quick Start   Copy the contents of \/dist into your project. From within dist, in the shell, run .\/core\/compile. Open dist\/public_html\/welcome.html and follow instructions.   Stand-alone implementation  If your goal is simply to document something, and these files will not integrate into another larger project (think git repo), then this is a stand-alone installation.  This would also be the case where you're using Loft Docs to build a website.  Loft Docs' root is the root of your project.  Here's the minimum file structure of a stand-alone implementation:  \/.gitignore \/core \/core-config.sh \/core-version.info \/public_html \/source \/stand_alone.info   In this scenario the version string of your project is contained in \/stand_alone.info which is one level above Loft Docs' core, and so your config file would contain this line:  version_file = \"..\/web_package.info\"   Or, for greater flexibility (so long as you've only one .info file), it could be:  version_file = \"..\/*.info\"   If you were to host this as a website, public_html is your web root.  Integrated implementation  If you are installing Loft Docs inside the existing code of a larger project, then this constitutes an integrated installation.  Loft Docs is not the root of the larger project, but a sub-folder, maybe you call it docs and store it in the root of the other project.  \/docs\/core \/other_project_file1 \/other_project_file2 \/other_project_file3 \/web_package.info   In this scenario the version string of your project is contained in \/web_package.info which is one levels above Loft Docs, and so your config file would contain this line:  version_file = \"..\/web_package.info\"   Or, for greater flexibility (so long as you've only one .info file), it could be:  version_file = \"..\/*.info\"  ","tags":"","url":"installation.html"},{"title":"Using API Blueprint","text":"  Loft Docs understands API Blueprint when you follow these conventions:   Install Aglio on your system.

Refer to these examples for more info.  Refer to the code example below: An Example Resource. Lastly create a wrapper page that uses an iframe and place it in source, e.g. api.md with at least a title and a reference iframe.

Including the Tasklist on Another Page  You can do something like the following in a .twig.md file, and the aggregated tasklist will appear there.  # Roadmap  Here are the todo items left for this project.  {% include('_tasklist.md') %}   Sorting Tasks in the Final List  You can control the order the tasks appear in the aggregated list by using the weight flag @w followed by an int or float number indicating the sort weight.  Lower numbers appear first.  The source file orders are not changed by the use of @w flag.  - [ ] a task list item @w-10 - [ ] a task list item @w10 - [ ] a task list item @w10.1  ","tags":"","url":"ld--todos.html"},{"title":"Token Replacement","text":"  Using frontmatter, you can define tokens in your markdown file that will be replaced during render.

How to compile  Each time you want to update your documentation files, after modifying files in source you need to execute compile from bash, make sure you are in the root directory of this package.  .\/core\/compile   Folders and Other Includes  By default folders in the source file are copied to the compiled output directories.  In some cases you will want greater control and\/or you will not want to mess up source with boilerplate folders.  For this reason there is a means to include files\/folders in the compiled output by creating a second directory, which is merged into to your final build.  Place your boilerplate content there.  For example to include a js directory in the website output you would create that folder as compile\/public_html\/js.  source\/     about.md compile\/     public_html\/         js\/             app.js             extra.js   If you've reconfigured the folder name for the website directory, make sure to match the folder structure to the reconfigured name.

Enable the hook file in core.config.sh, e.g., pre_hooks = \"pre_compile.php\"   You may specify one or more PHP or shell scripts to be called both before and\/or after compiling using the pre_hooks and post_hooks config options.  The paths you present are relative to {root}\/hooks.  Compilation pauses until each script is finished.  pre_hooks = \"pre_compile.sh pre_compile.php\" post_hooks = \"post_compile.sh post_compile.php\"   Arguments Sent to Scripts  The scripts will receive the following arguments:       php arg   bash arg   description       $argv[1]   $1   Path to the source\/ directory     $argv[2]   $2   Path to the core\/ directory     $argv[3]   $3   Path to the version file     $argv[4]   $4   Path to the parent directory of source, a.k.a the root directory     $argv[5]   $5   Path to the compiled website directory     $argv[6]   $6   Path to the compiled html directory     $argv[7]   $7   Path to the compiled text directory     $argv[8]   $8   Path to the compiled drupal directory     $argv[9]   $9   Path to write dynamic pages and includes before compile     $argv[10]   $10   Path to the outline JSON file     Generating Dynamic Content  Portions of your pages that need to be computed are generally going to be dynamic includes, which are included on your static pages named ending with .twig.md.  PHP Hooks  You have access to an instance of $compiler, which has most methods you'd need.  Also any core classes are available and autoloaded so you simple need to declare them via use statements at the top of your hook file, e.g.,  &lt;?php  use AKlump\\LoftDocs\\PhpClassMethodReader; ...   PHP hook files should only save content using a method on the $compiler instance.  To save an include file, use:  $compiler-&gt;addInclude(...   If you want to generate an entire dynamic page, you should use:  $compiler-&gt;addSourceFile(...   Be sure to check out these classes for help with dynamic content:   \\AKlump\\LoftLib\\Code\\Markdown \\AKlump\\LoftDocs\\PhpClassMethodReader   BASH Hooks  Dynamice files should be written to the directory defined in $9  Screen Output  You may print or echo from your script and it will be echoed to the user.

An Example     Goal: To create a file that defines a table and include that table in two different pages.   Your source directory will resemble the following:  . \u251c\u2500\u2500 _table.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 page.twig.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 page2.twig.md   The contents of &#95;table.md:  | Key | Value | |----------|----------| | Size | large  | | Shape | square |   The contents of page.twig.md:  # Page One  Here is the table:  {% include('_table.md') %}   The contents of page2.twig.md:  # Page Two  And again a reference to the table:  {% include('_table.md') %}       Creating Partials During Compile  Using a PHP hook file, you can generate dynamic partials during compile.  These can be referenced in your static source files just like other partials.  Here's an example of code for a hook file that generates a dynamic partial called &#95;headline.md.  Dynamic files are automatically cleaned up by the compiler.  &lt;?php $contents = \"## Today is: \" . date('r'); echo $compiler-&gt;addInclude('_headline.md', $contents)     -&gt;getBasename() .

How to explicitly tag content  If you need to add search tags to pages , use the front matter with the key: tags.  Follow these guidlines:   Tags MUST NOT contain a space.  --- tags: code php how-to ---    How to exclude a page from the search index  There are two ways.  For markdown source files, front matter is preferred.   Use the frontmatter like this:  --- search: noindex ---    When that can't be used, say for an .html file, you can use the outline.merge.json file with the  {     \"frontmatter\": [         {             \"master.apib.html\": {                 \"search\": \"noindex\"             }         }     ] }  ","tags":"","url":"qs--search.html"},{"title":"Terms Used","text":"       Term   Definition       Include   A snippet that is injected into another page     Partial   See Include     Dynamic Include   An include file that is generated at compile time.

The pages are listed alphabetically based on the page titles.  To overide this automation you will use a file called outline.merge.json which is also placed in the source directory; please refer to examples\/outline.json for the complete file schema.  To Change the Order  You can control the order of pages listed in the TOC by adding to outline.merge.json.  The order of items added to the sections key takes precedence.  All that is needed to affect order is the id.  In the following code snippet you see that installation will appear first in the index, followed by changelog.  The remaining files will appear in the default title ascending order.  Notice that in the second element the title key is also used in outline.merge.json.  This allows you to control the index title for a page, independant of the how the title is displayed when the page is viewed.  {     \"sections\": [         {             \"id\": \"installation\"         },         {             \"id\": \"changelog\",             \"title\": \"CHANGELOG\"         }     ],     ...   Using Chapters  It's often nice to subdivide your documentation into chapters and this is very easy to do.  It requires two additional steps:   Prepend files with a chapter &lt;chapter_id&gt;--, e.g. qs--installation.md and adv--files.md. Define the chapters in outline.merge.json.  {     \"chapters\": [         {             \"id\": \"qs\",             \"title\": \"Quick Start\"         },         {             \"id\": \"adv\",             \"title\": \"Advanced Usage\"         }     ], ....                Skipping Index of Some Files  To cause the automated indexing to skip over a page, either make that page a partial, e.g. &#95;fragment.md, or set the noindex frontmatter on the file.  See the frontmatter section for more info.  help.ini  This is the method that stems from the Drupal advanced help module and looks something like the following.  Using outline.merge.json is probably the better approach, and this will most likely be deprecated in future versions.

The default theme writes the version in the footer.  This page tells you how to indicate the version to the compiler.  If you do nothing the default version is always 1.0.  Point to a Static File  In core-config.sh you can point to a static file containing a version string.  Several file are understood including:   composer.json package.json &#42;.info   Add the following to core-config.sh:  version_file = \"\/some\/absolute\/path\/version.info\"   or a relative file (relative to the directory containing core-config.sh)  version_file = \"..\/composer.json\"   Point to a Script  In the event version_file is not sufficient you can point to a script that echos the version string of your documentation_.  These version hook script (PHP or BASH) receives the same arguments as the pre\/post hooks.  You define your version hook in config.  See version_hook.php as an implementation example.
